Employee Manager

Employee Manager is a Spring boot + React JS CRUD + MySQL application. This was created to be a responsive Spring Boot 
application based on the Model, View, Controller architecture. Using CRUD operations to manipulate data through the front
end and back end. Along with accessing RESTful API's from the React Front end using axios and Router. I faced a handful of
problems throughout the course of the project. Mainly dealing with getting full CRUD functionality through the Front End to 
the Back End.

The technologies used within the project for the Back End: MySql, SQL, Spring Tool Suite, & Postman
The technologies used within the project for the Front End: React, React-Router, Axious, JS, BootStrap

This project is still a work in progress, and I plan on adding a more functionality in the future. Which includes user 
authentication, publicly deploying the app, and adding in a 3rd party APi. 

I followed along this guide when setting up the initial portions of the project. https://www.javaguides.net/2020/07/spring-boot-react-js-crud-example-tutorial-spring-boot-backend-part1.html
